# Pseudo code part 2, planning for project completion

## Lots of work to be done for the 5-day forecast
- Loop for [I], to cycle through forecast days 1-5: this will decrease program friction and density
- Create div / card for each forecast day, will be better for styling 
- Create element (was thinking list item) for each data-point (date, temp, wind, humidity) within card
- Icons showing weather conditions (sunny/cloud/rainy/etc)

## Input button & Local storage
- Save 'search history' to local storage
- Create new button element, containing the local storage city value
- Ability to click button, which will re-run the API fetch with city name value

## Styling (priority is working icons)
- Clean up the structure
- Create footer with my name, todays date, etc.
- If/else statement for weather conditon icons
- Icon's shuld relate to weather condition for that data (rainy/cloud/sunny/etc.)
- Could I clear the textbox upon hitting search button? That would look nice..
